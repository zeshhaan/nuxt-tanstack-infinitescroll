## Getting up and running with TanStack on Nuxt 3

The repository is an example showcasing infinite scroll pagination using TanStack Query. I have seen a lot of folks in the community channels seeking help on this. I have tried VueUse's `useinfinitescroll` composable has got limitation and issues to use in a production app.

## Setup

Install vue-query Nuxt module. The installation instructions can be found on [this page](https://nuxt.com/modules/vue-query). This will install everything you would need to get started.

Checkout [TanStack Query Documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/vue/guides/infinite-queries) to learn more.
